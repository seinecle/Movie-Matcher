#Towards a MOOC "Creating Mobile Apps" for entrepreneurs
This code is all you need to create a mobile app that will run on phones and tablets from Android, iOS, Windows and BlackBerry.  
I am preparing a MOOC opening in September 2015 teaching how to create this app by yourself, as a training to create your own app.  

#What does the app do?  
You tell the app your preferences in movie genres, and it downloads the posters of new movie releases corresponding to your preferences.

#Can I test the app for real?
Yes. At the moment it is just on Android, search "Movie Matcher" by Clement Levallois in the Android Store (scroll down the list as this is not the 1st result returned).

#I have zero knowledge in coding. Can I enrol in this course?
Yes. The course is made for you.

#I am a developer. Can I enrol in this course?
Yes. You will learn how to code apps. The framework is Codename One and it is in Java, so if you don't know the language it's an opportunity to try it.  

#What? The framework is in Java and complete beginners are welcome?
Yes. Believe me, Java is easy as compared to other languages.
